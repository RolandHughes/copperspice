#  They should not have let CMake generate this file.

#  Fedora screwed the pooch, at least with 36 and possibly later. The UsrMove proposal went in and now
#  /bin    ->  /usr/bin
#  /lib    ->  /usr/lib
#  /lib64  ->  /usr/lib64
#  /sbin   ->  /usr/sbin
#
#  Because of that, you get File Conflict errors if you let RPMBUILD choose your included files because
#  it will include the destination directories if you have any files under them. If you look at your files
#  list it will have an entry for /usr/lib64 then a bunch of entries for /usr/lib64/something.so
#
#  Really sucks!

# No difference between upgrade and uninstall for these

# We did not do anything kinky like create links or files for ldconfig to consume
# May have to force an entry in $PATH but unknown right now. cmake files should already look there
